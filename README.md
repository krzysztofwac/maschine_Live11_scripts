how to configure maschine mk2 scripts for ableton live 11

1. copy contents of this repo directly to C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 11 Suite\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts
make sure they are unfolded ie: MIDI Remote Scripts/Maschine_mk1/actual_single_python_files otherwise they wont be visble by live

2. The NI Controller Editor is at version 2.0.2 R150. It includes factory 'template' for ableton 9. 
3. if the Maschine mk2 doesnt work try 'open configuration file' from NI CE. NB: make sure to save your current working configuration, give it a meaningful name. If things go wrong you can revert to it later.
4. If all goes well you should be having Masch mk1 and Masch Mk2 controllers working simultaneusly in Live 11.
note: 'device control mode' doesnt work as depicted here https://youtu.be/lnP1RM788Z4?t=632 with mk2
